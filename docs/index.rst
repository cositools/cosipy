Welcome to cosipy's documentation!
==================================

The cosipy library is `COSI <https://cosi.ssl.berkeley.edu/>`_'s high-level analysis software. It allows you to extract imaging and spectral information from the data, as well as to perform statistical model comparisons. The cosipy products are meant to be ready for interpretation.

The main repository is hosted at https://github.com/cositools/cosipy

In the following sections you will find:

- Installation instructions
- A tutorial series explaining the basics of various components of cosipy
- Further usage examples
- The Application Programming Interface (API), describes the various available classes, their properties, and usage.

.. warning::
   While many features are already available, cosipy is still actively under development. COSI is scheduled to launch in 2027. In preparation, the cosipy team will be releasing alpha versions with approximately an annual cadence. Your feedback will be greatly appreciated! Note, however, that these are not stable releases and various components can be modified or deprecated shortly.
