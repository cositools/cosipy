API
===

This is cosipy's Application Programming Interface (API). It is an exhaustive list of all available classes and their properties, as well as the inputs and outputs of each method.

If you are instead interested in an overview on how to use cosipy, see out `tutorial series instead <../tutorials/index.html>`_.

.. warning::
    Under construction. The description of some methods is still missing. If you need the description of a particular class, please open an `issue <https://github.com/cositools/cosipy/issues>`_ so we can prioritize it.
